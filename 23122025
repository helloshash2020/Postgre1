Below is a clear, enterprise-ready monitoring & alerting tool stack for GCP, including native GCP services and your requested tools: Prometheus, Grafana, AppDynamics, and xMatters.
This is aligned for production, hybrid, and customer-facing workloads on GKE.
📊 Monitoring & Alerting Tools for GCP (Recommended Stack)
🟦 1. Native GCP Monitoring & Alerting (Foundation Layer)
🔹 Cloud Monitoring (formerly Stackdriver)
Primary platform for infrastructure & GCP services
Monitors
GKE (nodes, pods, containers)
Load Balancers
Cloud SQL
Memorystore (Redis)
VPN / Interconnect
GCS
Capabilities
Metrics collection
Alert policies
SLO / SLA monitoring
Uptime checks
✅ Best for infra-level alerts
✅ Tight integration with all GCP services
🔹 Cloud Logging
Centralized log management
Application logs (Spring Boot)
GKE logs
Audit logs
Security logs
Used together with:
Log-based metrics
Log-based alerts (error spikes, auth failures)
🟩 2. Prometheus (Metrics Collection – Kubernetes Focus)
🔹 Managed Service for Prometheus (GCP)
Recommended over self-hosted Prometheus
Monitors
Kubernetes metrics (CPU, memory, pod health)
Application custom metrics
JVM metrics (Micrometer)
Why Managed Prometheus
No maintenance
Auto-scaling
Long-term storage
Native Cloud Monitoring integration
Copy code

Spring Boot → Micrometer → Prometheus → Cloud Monitoring
✅ Best for deep GKE + app-level metrics
🟨 3. Grafana (Visualization Layer)
🔹 Grafana (Managed or Self-Hosted on GKE)
Data Sources
Prometheus (GCP Managed)
Cloud Monitoring
Cloud SQL metrics
Redis metrics
Use Cases
Business dashboards
SRE dashboards
Capacity planning
Latency / throughput visualization
Copy code

Prometheus + Cloud Monitoring → Grafana Dashboards
✅ Best for visual insights & exec dashboards
🟥 4. AppDynamics (APM – Application Performance Monitoring)
🔹 AppDynamics
Deep application-level observability
Monitors
Spring Boot transactions
JVM internals
Database queries
External API calls
End-user experience
Capabilities
Distributed tracing
Code-level diagnostics
Baseline anomaly detection
Copy code

Spring Boot Agent → AppDynamics Controller
✅ Best for application performance & RCA
🟪 5. xMatters (Alerting & Incident Management)
🔹 xMatters
Enterprise alert orchestration & on-call management
Receives alerts from
Cloud Monitoring
Prometheus Alertmanager
AppDynamics
Custom webhooks
Capabilities
On-call schedules
Escalation policies
SMS / Voice / Email / Teams / Slack
Incident workflows
Copy code

Monitoring Tools → xMatters → On-call Teams
✅ Best for incident response & escalation
🔁 End-to-End Monitoring & Alert Flow (Recommended)
